# ML4FG-class-project

This Github repository holds data and code of our ML4FG class project. 

  "cnn_fc_model.py" holds the model definition and forward method of the CNN+fully connected layer model, which is the one iDeep uses.

  "cnn_lstm_model.py" holds the model definition and forward method of the CNN+LSTM model, which is our first attempt of improvement.

  "training_method.py" hods the function that trains the model with early stopping and data coming from dataloader.
