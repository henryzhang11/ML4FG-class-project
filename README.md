# ML4FG-class-project

This Github repository holds data and code of our ML4FG class project. 

"cnn_fc.py" holds the model definition and forward method of the CNN-fully connected layer model, which is the one iDeep uses. It also includes a training function with early stopping.

"cnn_lstm.py" holds the model definition and forward method of the CNN-LSTM model, which is our first attempt of improvement. It also includes a training function with early stopping.
  
"cnn_transformer.py" holds the model definition and forward method of the CNN-Transformer model, which is our first attempt of improvement. It also includes a training function with early stopping.
